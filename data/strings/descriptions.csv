aic_cap1,SHIP,"Massive engines and enough guns to rip and tear through enemy fleets with no remorse, the Chimera's mere existance is a rumour as this monstrous collection of armor plating and weapon mounts were welded together somewhere deep in the jungles of Perihelion, the Union only use it on operations where it's absolutely necessary to ensure operational goals. Original desgin specifications included the ability easily crush Hegemony and Church Legions and Onslaughts which it does with impunity, this kind of fire power is only rivaled by the Paragon. Built from mostly Legion, Onslaught and other parts that can easily be acquired and produced on Perihelion this clever design completely surprised both  the Hegemony and the Church who believed that the Union would be incapable of producing such large vessels covertly and on their own.",,,

aic_cap1r,SHIP,"Massive engines and with enough guns to rip and tear through enemy fleets with no remorse, the Rhinochimaera's mere existance is a rumour as this monstrous collection of armor plating and weapon mounts were welded together somewhere deep in the depths of the outer Sector, custom built and commanded by the fearsome Levon Trosky. Boasts supercapital like capabilities with incredible range and firepower, with matching durability.",,,

aic_cap2,SHIP,"A nimble battlecruiser built around an experimental propulsion system. High difficulty and cost of construction keep these ships from becoming more commonly adapted. The Falling Sun excels at both hit & run and flanking maneuvers thanks to good mix of firepower and mobility.",,,

aic_cap2boss,SHIP,"Entirely unique modification of Falling Sun battlecruiser, made with unknown purpose in mind. Function of all the lavish additions onboard remains a mystery. Are they just for show, an image of lavish lifestyle beyond reach of most or do they serve a more meaningful function? You'll probably never know the truth of that. A very advanced battlecruiser the Firepower excels at both hit & run and flanking maneuvers thanks to good mix of firepower and mobility.",,,

aic_legionc,SHIP,"Custom built and then modified by the Union, this Legion has been given new specialised weapons and a distinctive stripy paint-job which it's named after, the massive built-in Hook MRM Arrays with the capability to overwhelm an entire fleets worth of point defense specialize the ship into more of a supportive role in Union fleets. The Red Legion entered production once the retrofit and weapons were engineered and tested for it after the discovery and the subsequent acquisition of a functioning Legion blueprint on Perihelion by one of the many tech-miners. as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.",,,

aic_cruiser3,SHIP,"One of the high points of Union engineering. The Apocylapse heavy cruiser combines high firepower and durability with strong shields, decent armor and a MIRV mine layer. It has great standoff power but comes with very limited mobility. Advanced electronics and sensors built into the ship used for mine teleports will also double as ECM/ECCM during downtime.",,,

aic_cruiser4,SHIP,"The Nighthawk is an experimental fast carrier/attack cruiser hybrid intended to harass and kite enemy forces. Its light weapons layout is complimented by the highly advanced Dragonfish heavy fighters which can create a good distraction allowing for highly effective harassment of enemy forces. Although the complicated and sensitive machinery used onboard create many headaches to the engineering team everytime something out of the ordinary goes wrong. Nighthawk's design and origin is a large mystery to other factions there are many theories and rumours circulating about the Nighthawk's capabilities and origins, usually including Tri-Tachyon involvement, alpha-level AI or both. The Hegemony are particulary interested in its design specs and are offering a considerable bounty to anyone willing to turn in a fully functional Nighthawk.",,,

aic_carrierd1,SHIP,"The Rhhea is a heavy duty carrier designed to be ubiqiotus and to have a  relatively cheap production cost, but that does leave it lacking in major strengths by design. Its very common in Union fleets thanks to these traits so it's used frequently in fleets of all sizes. Although as expected its dead in the water on its own and has a rather large maintenance profile for a destroyer.",,,

aic_dess1,SHIP,"Rupture is the ultimate standoff ship built to be frustratingly durable and with an impressive array of weapons, the built-in damper field and integrated targeting unit allow it to go toe to toe with some cruisers.

aic_frig4,SHIP,"Constructed around the advanced sensor systems capable of Target Painting, the Blackbird is a very useful utility ship based on distracting the enemy with its high durability and speed. Very limited weapons layout and lightweight construction severely limit its power when on its own. The above avarage cost and more complex design limit its more widespread use.",,,

The Coydog is one of the better freighters when it comes to combat prowess, but this comes at the cost of an increased price tag.",,,

aic_cerberusr,SHIP,"A Surplus hull modified and ""upgraded"" by the Revolution. The Cerberus is prized for providing a cost-effective balance between cargo capacity and enough combat power for its size to discourage casual piracy with the happy result of lowered insurance rates compared to standard Domain-era civilian grade freighters. The Cerberus is now widely considered to be a wise platform of operation for independent traders in the Sector.",,,

aic_houndr,SHIP,"A Surplus hull modified and ""upgraded"" by the Revolution.

A familiar civilian design, the ""Kite""-class aeroshuttle is the day-to-day reminder of Fabrique Orbitale's reputation for aeronautical engineering- a valuable specialty even in the age of space travel. This compact space/aircraft is streamlined for efficient atmospheric flight and boasts a grid of cleverly distributed short-burst 
uvering thrusters coordinated by a delta-level AI subsystem to ensure smooth landings (a point driven home by Fabrique marketing by way of amusing ad-holos featuring a well-dressed couple and an overfull wine glass).

aic_colossusr,SHIP,"A Surplus hull modified and ""upgraded"" by the Revolution. The Colossus was first adapted for war by Pather militants, but enterprising pirates soon followed their lead. A similarly haphazard process sees most cargo decks collapsed and re-welded to form thick armour dotted with numerous weapons emplacements. The primary cargo bay was left open, however, and converted into an ersatz fighter launch bay with the addition of a micro civilian forge-vat intended for the manufacture of machine parts hacked to accept fighter LPC chips. The forge is poorly integrated with the hull's base power system, resulting in unreliable overall performance.",,,

Most factions don't like the new competition in the sector and heavily associate them with pirates, but not quite all factions share this idea though. The Union has connections in the League and have a deal with the local government at Naxos for the control of the Providence star system in the ongoing border conflict. Rumours circulate about heavy sponsorship by Tri-Tachyon who are supposedly using them to field test new questonably legal technologies. Their arrival is very troubling to the Hegemony and the Church due to them challenging their authority over the sector, they quickly reached a boiling point with Hegemony as skirmishes started growing into larger and larger battles. Deemed as nothing more than pirates, smugglers and other low-lifes by their enemies the Union has fought bitterly to survive in the Sector.

It is said that the Union were some band of pirates and misfits that decided to recolonize Perihelion, which does reflect their less lawful tendencies. Although nowadays they try their hardest to move away from being associated as Pirates. The actual planetary backbone of the Union are the countless largely independendent mininig and salvaging operations, light industries and small research labs dotting their planets surfaces, which are fed resources by the countless raiding operations launched by the Union bringing back scrap and salvage materials. Many come seeking a better fortune working for the Union far away from the more oppressive governments and states of the sector. Minimal oversight by the Union has allowed for high economic growth as long as taxes are paid and relative order is maintained they don't care much for what goes on. This same ragtag way of business extends to the Union military.

Although no planet-killer device was used it was still shortly abandoned by the Hegemony after the event due to resources being stretched incredibly thin by the war and  trying to repair damage of such a massive scale would only have been worwhile in the long term.

After a sometime from the ashes rose a new peculiar faction who called themselves the Free Stars Union, united in the missions to bring freedom to the oppressed people of the sector.

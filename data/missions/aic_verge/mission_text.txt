Location: In Hyperspace some distance from Old Man Star
Date: 203.9.23

In cycle 203 a large task force was assembled in response to rapidly growing Union activity by the Hegemony with some support given from the Church, Its goal was to attack and permanently cripple all hostile operations happening in Old Man Star. Once the Union caught wind of the operation the order was given from Grand Admiral Ganymede to assemble a pre-emptive strike, After careful consideration of many options it was deemed that this was most likely to succeed with the help of a yet unkown threat for the rest of the sector. The FSUN Erebus a Chimera class fortress ship was just barely finished and functional its design yet to be proven in combat, Its command was given to captain Dahr a well decorated veteran in the Union navy since the very early days, Now the entire fate of the Union would be on his hands. Failure to sufficiently damage the Task force will lead to certain doom for both Dahr and the Union. 

Once the strike force had managed to sneak their way into hyperspace and close enough to the now mostly assembled task force they charged right into attack all weapons hot. This caught the task force by surprise and the captains and crew were shocked to find such a huge fleet appearing on their sensors from thin air. It was carefully anylyzed and predicted by Hegemony intelligence officials that the Union could not field a fleet with enough firepower to challenge the task force in fair combat. After a long and grueling fight where the FSUN Erebus fearlessly charged into the enemy capitals and emerged victorious, Although badly damaged in the close fighting it and captain Dahr had left the task force in complete disarray and full retreat, Mission failure had to be soon announced by the remaining Hegemony Officers. Now the battle lives on as the event where the Union was almost wiped out if it wasn't for one do or die battle.

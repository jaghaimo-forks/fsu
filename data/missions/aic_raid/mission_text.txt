Location: Somewhere in the outer Corvus system
Date: 205.10.18

The Union raiders lead by Fleet Captain Deimos have been blocked by the Hegemony patrol somewhere in the outer Corvus system. Deimos makes the hard choice to attack the patrol head-on since any attempt to evade them has been unsuccesful. Any further delays in the operation would risk the arrival of reinforcements in Corvus and ruin the chances of mission success. Good thing Deimos has just been promoted to captain the experimental Nighthawk cruiser, A ship with very high capabilities. Since he will need every bit of firepower to pull this daring move off.
